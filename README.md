### Hi there 👋

I desire to change my career into soft engineering which is quite different from my experiences.
- 🔭 I have tried some industries, like civil engineering, marine engineering as well as environmental engineering. 
- ⚡ I always worked on some coding (python) by myself and excited about those puzzles or new understandings.
- 🤔 I'm currently keeping leraning full-stack, including React, Nextjs, Express, Appwrites and so on.
- 🌱 I choose Alpha Camp to be a "real beginning" and had set a crystal clear target and will get there ASAP.
